# FOREWARD FOR MY BOOK
 (yeah... I accidentally wrote a book... sorry.)

### "I don't know what's better, THE BISCUIT OR THE SHAME." -Dylan Moran

I thought that I would feel good, publishing this. However, the only thing I feel is shame. 
Should I keep editing, until this becomes less trashy?

No, because I need to move on. NOW.

I always hated New Years Eve. "What's the point? It's just another day." However, people in Sakartvelo LOVE New Years. 
Although I was never allowed to partake in traditional Georgian ceremonies... their obsession changed me. 

Therefore, I cannot drag this into 2022. And as trashy as this is, I also cannot throw it away, because I know how it feels to throw away music. 
Science only knows how many compositions & recording I have thrown away... for example: would any of you believe that I played 
"Somewhere Over The Rainbow" arranged by Max Seide Leth??
